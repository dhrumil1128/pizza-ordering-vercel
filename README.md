# Pizza Ordering Site (React Frontend)

This repository contains the frontend code for a simulated pizza ordering application built using React.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Create React App structure:
- `src/App.jsx`: Main application logic, UI components, and mock API handling.
- `src/index.js`: Entry point for React rendering.
- `public/index.html`: Root HTML file.

## Frontend Code

The `src/App.jsx` file includes:
1. Mock data and simulated asynchronous API calls for fetching the menu and submitting orders.
2. Components for Header, PizzaCard, OrderSummary, and OrderForm.
3. State management for menu loading, cart contents, and order submission status.

## Deployment Instructions (Vercel)

This project is designed for deployment on Vercel:

1. **Connect Repository:** Connect this GitHub repository to your Vercel account via the Vercel dashboard.
2. **Framework Preset:** Vercel should automatically detect this as a Create React App/Vite project (or use the Generic preset).
3. **Build Command:** `npm run build`
4. **Output Directory:** `build` (or `dist` depending on build tool, but standard CRA is `build`).

**Note:** Since the backend is mocked within the frontend, no separate backend deployment steps are required for this initial setup.

**Live URLs:** Once deployed on Vercel, the live URL will be automatically generated by Vercel.
